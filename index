                answers: ["Superblock", "Inode", "Directory entry", "Journal"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "An inode (index node) is a data structure that stores all metadata about a file except its name, including permissions, ownership, timestamps, and pointers to data blocks."
            },
            {
                question: "True or False: In APFS (Apple File System), files can share data blocks through a feature called 'cloning', which is important for forensic investigators to understand when calculating actual disk usage.",
                answers: ["True", "False"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "True. APFS supports cloning where multiple files can reference the same data blocks. This copy-on-write feature means the actual disk usage might be less than the sum of file sizes."
            },
            {
                question: "Which timestamp in a Linux file system is NOT updated when a file is simply read or accessed?",
                answers: ["atime (access time)", "mtime (modification time)", "ctime (change time)", "All are updated when reading"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The mtime (modification time) is only updated when the file's content is modified, not when it's simply read. The atime updates on access, and ctime updates when metadata changes."
            },
            {
                question: "In HFS+ (Mac OS Extended), what is the name of the special file that keeps track of all allocated blocks on the volume?",
                answers: ["Catalog File", "Allocation File", "Extents Overflow File", "Attributes File"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Allocation File (also called the Volume Bitmap) tracks which blocks are allocated and which are free on an HFS+ volume."
            },
            {
                question: "When a file is deleted in ext4, what typically happens to the inode?",
                answers: ["It's immediately overwritten with zeros", "It's marked as unallocated but data remains", "It's moved to a trash folder", "It's encrypted"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "When a file is deleted in ext4, the inode is marked as unallocated but the actual inode data often remains intact until overwritten, allowing for potential recovery."
            },
            {
                question: "True or False: APFS uses a copy-on-write metadata scheme that creates snapshots, making it possible to recover previous versions of files even after deletion.",
                answers: ["True", "False"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "True. APFS's copy-on-write system and snapshot feature can preserve previous versions of files and file system states, which can be valuable for forensic recovery."

                answers: ["/etc", "/var/log", "/usr/bin", "/home"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "/var/log contains system and application log files including auth.log, syslog, and various service logs that are essential for forensic timeline reconstruction."
            },

                question: "What is the default inode size in ext4 file system?",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The default inode size in ext4 is 256 bytes, which allows for extended attributes and nanosecond timestamps compared to the 128 bytes in ext2/3."
            },

                question: "In macOS, which file contains information about files that have been moved to the Trash?",
                answers: [".DS_Store", ".Trash", ".localized", ".Spotlight-V100"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: ".DS_Store files store custom attributes of a folder including information about files in Trash. The actual Trash folder is .Trash, but .DS_Store contains metadata."
            },
            {
                question: "True or False: The journal in ext4 file system can contain remnants of deleted file data, making it a valuable source for forensic recovery.",
                answers: ["True", "False"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "True. The journal in ext4 can contain metadata and sometimes data from recent transactions, including information about deleted files before the deletion was committed."
            },

                question: "What is the maximum file size supported by APFS?",
                answers: ["4 GB", "8 TB", "8 EiB (exbibytes)", "16 EiB"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "APFS supports a maximum file size of 8 EiB (exbibytes), which is approximately 9.2 exabytes, making it suitable for very large files."

                question: "In Linux, which command would a forensic investigator use to view detailed inode information?",

                correct: 1,

                question: "True or False: In ext4, the 'lazytime' mount option delays writing timestamp updates to disk, which can affect the accuracy of forensic timeline analysis.",
                answers: ["True", "False"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "True. The lazytime option delays timestamp updates to improve performance, which means timestamps in memory might differ from those on disk until synchronized."
